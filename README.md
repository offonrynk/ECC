# Error Correcting Codes (ECCs)

Development of different ECCs (error correcting codes) for memory systems

The various codes implemented are

- A (72, 64) [SEC-DED](SEC-DED) Code which corrects single bit errors

- A (72, 64) Dutta [SEC-DED-DAEC](SEC-DED-DAEC) (Single Error Correcting – Double Error Detecting – Double Adjacent Error Correcting) code

- A (72, 64) [SEC-DAED-DAEC-TAED](SEC-DAED-DAEC-TAED) (Single Error Correcting – Double Error Detecting – Double Adjacent Error Correcting – Triple Adjacent Error Detecting) code

- A (72, 64) [SEC-DED-DAEC-6AED](SEC-DED-DAEC-6AED) (Single Error Correcting – Double Error Detecting – Double Adjacent Error Correcting – 6 Adjacent Error Detecting) code
