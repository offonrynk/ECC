# SEC-DED-DAEC-TAED Code

VHDL implementaton of a (72, 64) SEC-DED-DAEC-TAED code proposed by [Adam Neale et al. (2012)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6376147) that

- corrects randomly scattered single bit errors and adjacent double bit errors
- detects random double bit errors as well as adjacent triple bit errors
- reduces miscorrection probability due to syndrome computation method
